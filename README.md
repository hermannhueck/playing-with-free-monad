# Playing with the Free Monad

I took some code from the following sources ...

- https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/freemonad.html
- https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/freeapplicative.html
- https://github.com/pvillega/free-monad-sample
- https://gist.github.com/runarorama/a8fab38e473fafa0921d

... and played around with it in order to study the free monad
and the free applicative.
